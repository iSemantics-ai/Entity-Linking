# Entity-Linking
Entity linking is a project that involves using rule-based normalization methods developed in Inferess to create pairs of positive and hard negative datasets. These datasets are then used to train a contrastive encoder capable of mapping company names into 384 vectors. The matching process is performed using the Faiss Algorithm.
